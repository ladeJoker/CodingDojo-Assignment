//immutable variables declared by --> val

// mutable variables declared by --> var

//printing to user --> print() for one line, println() print a statement & \n

//get input from user --> readLine() & the input can be customized such as readLine().toString

/*variables can be print to user by
    1) directly --> print(variable)
    2) indirectly --> print("$variable hello world") using the dolar sign */

//assigning data type to the variables --> var nameVariable: String

//String have different library inside once we press dot after such as --> msg.replace(,)

/*use try{}..catch(e: Exception){} to let the program work softly without to be crush, we use it usually with
unexpected entries such as from the users.
 */

//condition make by --> if...else if..else, important note! i have to pay attention to the arrangement such as start by int or str?

//for repeated pattern or list select ---> for, while loop

//lowerLayers values can be cast as an implicit but higherLayer variables is explicit so we have do it manually

//if i have a list that user should pick from use --> when(){... else -> } as it is the synonymous to the switch in java
