//functions can have a return type --> fun nameFun(input: String): String{}

//if i want to check about the user entry type --> use try..catch && input.toType

/*to check whether an option exist in a limited list --> use when such that:
when(input){
            '*' -> {}
            '-' -> {}
            '+' -> {}
            '/' -> {}
            else -> {
                numeric = false
            }
}
 */

//when get the input from user & the type of entry didnt specified from the beganning --> use ReadLine()!!

/*i can specify a variable from the beganning is a char or
 when i get the input made it as input[0] to get the first index and consider it as char.
 */

/*
the difference between array and arraylist is that,
array is mutable, i can change items inside it
the List is immutable, i cant change anything on it!
both of it have fixed size which mean that they are not dynamic &, can have only one type at time
 */

/*
on the other hand, ArrayList or arrayListOf are mutable, have dynamic size,
can hold values and objects, can have either a specific dataType or all the type at time
 */

/*
we can create a nested array list to be as 2D dimention & 3D dimention as i want
such as:
-ArrayList<ArrayList<String>>()
-arrayListOf<ArrayList<String>>()
ArrayList<arrayListOf<String>>() --> works only if i add the elements at the entry time such like:
val countriesCapital = ArrayList<Any>()
countriesCapital.add(arrayListOf(capital,country))
 */

/*
at the printing, when the $ sign doesnt hold all the variable --> use the {} such as:
print("${array[0].remove}")
 */
